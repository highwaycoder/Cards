# Cards
Cards is a solution to [the problem posed by Reg Braithwaite](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/please-design-deck-of-cards-in-java.html)
In order to both stretch my architecture skills and add to my portfolio.

## Implementation
I have actually gone a bit above-and-beyond the call of duty and implemented many methods.
However, it should not be judged on its implementation - the point of the exercise
was to demonstrate skills in architecture, not skills in implementation.  Therefore,
I concentrated much harder on creating a structure within my code than I did on 
implementation details.
For example, my implementation of Deck.shuffle() is rather crude, and could be greatly
improved upon given enough time to do so.

## Notes
I should point out that this code is untested - again, this is because it's not the
implementation that matters, it's the architecture.  It does compile cleanly, but that's
only because Eclipse bugs me about errors until I fix them.  I had begun writing it
in Geany for this reason, but got a bit lost without my ever-helpful JavaDoc tooltips.
Damn you Eclipse for making me rely upon IDE magic for my understanding of Java!
